So it finally happened, I finally got some free time to put up my first post. And what i'm really doing is just 'testing' out this post stuff. Unfortunately, I really don't have anything clever to say or talk about at the moment, except... have you checked out my github projects page yet? If not, go check it out I recently put up my Chip8 emulator project and a FPS game called 'Promethean-Drift'. It's pretty cool.. I was motivated by games such as Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, etc... basically the original ID software team lol. There should be some links floating around here somewhere (check my "about" section). Anyway, I hope to post again soon and hopefully get around to posting more of my projects. Hopefully these projects or games interest you as they interest me and you're able to get something out of it.
