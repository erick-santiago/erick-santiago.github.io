So it happened again, I finally got some free time in my free time to put up my first post lol. That's right, I only work on this website when I get some down time in my free time. What'd you think? I was actually going to waste precious seconds of my life on this thing? Pffft... no wayyy dude... c'mon. I'm lucky if I even touch this throughout my day. Anyway, so here it is my first post... Hope you're reading this and wasting time (aha kidding of course), as soon as some stuff comes up I'll be sure to post more stuff up here and keep you entertained. Have you checked out my github projects page yet? No!? Go check it out what are you waiting for, I got some pretty cool stuff on there, there should be some links floating around here to reach it. Anyway... till next time, same bat time same bat channel.
